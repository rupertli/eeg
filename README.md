# Learning notes
I am learning EEG emotion classification based on SEED V dataset, what I am trying is to:
 - Find more feature based on congnitize science, brain science and physics of EEG signal
 - Find right model to identify pattern from thes features for better accuracy
 - Find most selective channels and bands to only use less data to achieve better accuracy

# Potential topics:
- CNN to capture spatial pattern like cross band or cross channel pattern
- Tranformer to constrcute feature vector space
- EEG signal
- Signal processing (FFT, CWT)
- Python library
